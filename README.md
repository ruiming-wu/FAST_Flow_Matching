## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several main modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the project:

- **data/**  
  Collected trajectory data, parameters, and visualizations.  

- **data_collection/**  
  Scripts and utilities for generating and saving control trajectories using PID controllers.  

- **inference/**  
  Code for running inference and evaluation with trained models. 

- **model/**  
  Model definitions, including Transformer architectures for sequence modeling and flow matching.  

- **train/**  
  Training scripts, logs, and checkpoints for model optimization and evaluation.  

- **utils/**  
  Helpful scripts.

Each module contains a dedicated README with further explanations and usage instructions.
