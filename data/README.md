# data Folder Description

This folder contains 4000 collected trajectories for the Inverted Pendulum environment. Each trajectory consists of 100 time steps and has been verified to be valid and stable at the end.

## Data Generation Details

- **Parameter Randomization:**  
  PID parameters are randomized by scaling the following base values by a factor uniformly sampled from 0.9 to 1.1:
  - `Kp1`: -3.0, `Ki1`: -0.01, `Kd1`: -0.15
  - `Kp2`: 0.08, `Ki2`: 0.05, `Kd2`: 0.001

- **Initial State:**  
  The 4-dimensional initial state is uniformly sampled within ±0.5 for each dimension.

- **PID Output Noise:**  
  Before being applied to the simulation environment, each PID output is perturbed with uniform noise in the range of ±0.05 N.  
  *Note: This noise is not recorded in the actions of `trajs` files, but is intended to encourage the model to learn noise robustness.*

## Data Quality

- All 4000 trajectories are valid and meet the stability criterion.

## File Structure

- `trajs/`: Contains the trajectory `.npy` files (shape: 100×5, 4D state + 1D action per step).
- `params/`: Contains the PID parameters and initial state for each trajectory.
- `trajs_pics/`: Contains visualization images for each trajectory.
- `training_pairs_original.npz`: Contains 100000 training pairs, each consisting of a state (`state`, shape: [1, 4]) and a following action sequence (`action`, shape: [1, 50]) generated by the PID controller. This file is mainly used for training and evaluating the tiny pi0.
- `training_pairs_fast.npz`: Contains 100000 training pairs, each consisting of a state (`state`, shape: [1, 4]) and a compressed/quantized action representation (`action_chunk`, shape: [N, 25]) suitable for the tiny pi0fast.
